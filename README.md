# Motivate Me

### Motivate Me is a social platform where users can provide encouragement to one another in their healthy lifestyle journeys
### [Click here to try the app deployed to Heroku](https://motivate-me-project.herokuapp.com/)

### This MEAN stack application was built by [Yeni Nomezqui](https://github.com/Rolita1007), [William Raush](https://github.com/WilliamRausch), and [Monica Grages](https://github.com/MonicaGrages) for our Web Development Immersive class at General Assembly.
#### Technologies utilized in this project:
* Node/Express
* Mongo/Mongoose
* AngularJS/JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

#### Because this was the first project we completed using git collaboration, we were very methodical in our approach to dividing responsibilities between our group. We successfully avoided difficult merge conflicts by communicating frequently about what we were working on individually, as well as utilizing driver/navigator pair programming for larger components.

#### In version 2, we plan to incorporate:
* User ability to save/share favorite motivational quotes
* Add user ability to upload photos with their posts
* Calorie needs calculator model
